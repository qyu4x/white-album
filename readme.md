- Principles of greedy algorithms
- Classical greedy problems (activity selection, Huffman coding, coin change, etc.)

### Backtracking
- Principles of backtracking
- Classical backtracking problems (N-queens, Sudoku, permutations and combinations, etc.)

### Divide and Conquer
- Principles of divide and conquer
- Classical divide and conquer problems (merge sort, quick sort, closest pair of points, etc.)

### Bit Manipulation
- Basics of bit manipulation
- Common bit manipulation tricks and problems

### Graph Algorithms
